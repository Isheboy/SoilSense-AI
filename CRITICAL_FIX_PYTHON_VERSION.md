# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Remove PYTHON_VERSION Environment Variable

## ❌ The Problem:

You're getting this error:

```
The PYTHON_VERSION must provide a major, minor, and patch version, e.g. 3.8.1.
You have requested 3.11.
```

**Root Cause**: You added `PYTHON_VERSION = 3.11` as an environment variable in Render, but:

1. The `runtime.txt` file already specifies Python version
2. The environment variable is **overriding** the `runtime.txt` file
3. The environment variable has the wrong format (`3.11` instead of `3.11.9`)

---

## ✅ The Solution:

### **REMOVE the PYTHON_VERSION environment variable entirely!**

The Python version should ONLY be in the `runtime.txt` file, not as an environment variable.

---

## 🔧 How to Fix (Step-by-Step):

### Step 1: In Render Dashboard

1. Go to your service: **soilsense-ai-backend**
2. Click **"Environment"** tab (left sidebar)
3. Find the **`PYTHON_VERSION`** variable
4. Click the **trash icon** (🗑️) or **"Delete"** button next to it
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Render will automatically redeploy

### Step 2: Verify Other Variables

Make sure you have ONLY these **5 environment variables**:

```
✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
✅ EARTHENGINE_PROJECT
✅ SUPABASE_URL
✅ SUPABASE_KEY
✅ ALLOWED_ORIGINS
```

**❌ DO NOT HAVE:**

```
❌ PYTHON_VERSION (Remove this!)
```

---

## 📋 Why This Works:

1. **runtime.txt** file contains: `python-3.11.9` ✅
2. Render reads this file automatically
3. No environment variable needed or wanted!
4. Environment variables override runtime.txt (causes conflict)

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next:

1. **After removing PYTHON_VERSION**:
   - Render starts automatic redeployment
   - Build uses `runtime.txt` for Python version
   - Uses Python 3.11.9 correctly
2. **Watch the logs**:
   - Should see successful build
   - Python packages installing
   - Server starting up
3. **Success indicators**:
   ```
   ✓ Earth Engine initialized successfully
   ✓ AI Recommendation Service initialized
   ✓ Database Service initialized
   INFO: Application startup complete
   ```

---

## 🔄 Alternative: If Starting Fresh

If you want to delete and recreate the service:

1. **Delete the service** in Render dashboard
2. **Create new web service**
3. **Add ONLY these 5 environment variables**:
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - EARTHENGINE_PROJECT
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_KEY
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS
4. **DO NOT add PYTHON_VERSION!**
5. Deploy

## 📚 Updated Documentation:

All documentation files have been updated to reflect this:

- ✅ Only 5 environment variables (removed PYTHON_VERSION)
- ✅ Python version handled by `runtime.txt`
- ✅ No conflicts between env var and runtime.txt

**Files updated:**

- `RENDER_ENV_VARS.md`
- `DEPLOY_NOW.md`
- `backend/render.yaml`

---

## ⚠️ Key Takeaway:

**For Render deployment:**

- ✅ Use `runtime.txt` for Python version
- ❌ Don't use PYTHON_VERSION environment variable
- ✅ Environment variables are for API keys and URLs only

---

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check Environment tab**: Confirm PYTHON_VERSION is deleted
2. **Check runtime.txt**: Should say `python-3.11.9`
3. **Force redeploy**: Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit
4. **Check logs**: Look for Python version being used

---

**After this fix, deployment should succeed!** 🎉
